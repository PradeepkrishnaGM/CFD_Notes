# Example Cases

## Effect of Grid

The accuracy and efficiency of numerical solutions depend significantly on the grid used for discretization. Different grid resolutions and types can affect the solution quality.

## Effect of Different Solvers

### Interpolation Methods

- **Upwind Differencing Scheme (UDS)**
- **Central Differencing Scheme (CDS)**
- **QUICK Scheme**
- **Power Law Interpolation**

The choice of interpolation method can impact the stability and accuracy of the numerical solution.
