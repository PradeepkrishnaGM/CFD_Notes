# Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)

## What is CFD?

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a subject that deals with numerical analysis and algorithms to solve and analyze problems involving fluid flows. CFD employs computational resources to simulate the interaction of fluids (liquids and gases) with surfaces and external forces.

## What is Simulation?

Simulation involves the process of creating a model that mimics a system and its dynamic processes, allowing for experimentation to derive results that can be applied to reality.

## Advantages of CFD

- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces the need for expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes and experiments.
- **Detailed Insights**: Provides detailed visualization of fluid behavior, including velocity fields, pressure distribution, and temperature variations which may sometime be difficult to find from a experiment.
- **Flexibility**: Can simulate a wide range of conditions and scenarios that may be difficult to replicate experimentally for example "heat tranfer in a nuclear powerplant".
- **Optimization**: Helps in the design and optimization of systems involving fluid flow, enhancing performance and efficiency and also enabling for rapid prototying.

## Disadvantages of CFD

- **Computational Resources**: Requires significant computational power and time, especially for complex and high-resolution simulations.
- **Accuracy**: The accuracy of CFD results depends on the quality of the models, mesh, and boundary conditions used.
- **Complexity**: Setting up and interpreting CFD simulations can be complex and requires specialized knowledge.

## Applications of CFD

- Aerodynamics of vehicles.
- Applications involving Heat and mass transfer.
- Multiphase Flows
- and other applications such as free surface hydrodynamics, pedestrian dynamics and so on.
