# Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)

## What is CFD?

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and algorithms to solve and analyze problems involving fluid flows. CFD employs computational resources to simulate the interaction of fluids (liquids and gases) with surfaces and external forces.

## What is Simulation?

Simulation in CFD refers to the use of computer-based models to replicate the behavior of fluid flows in various scenarios. By solving the fundamental equations governing fluid motion, simulations provide insights into the characteristics of fluid dynamics without physical testing.

## Advantages of CFD

- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces the need for expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes and experiments.
- **Detailed Insights**: Provides detailed visualization of fluid behavior, including velocity fields, pressure distribution, and temperature variations.
- **Flexibility**: Can simulate a wide range of conditions and scenarios that may be difficult to replicate experimentally.
- **Optimization**: Helps in the design and optimization of systems involving fluid flow, enhancing performance and efficiency.

## Disadvantages of CFD

- **Computational Resources**: Requires significant computational power and time, especially for complex and high-resolution simulations.
- **Accuracy**: The accuracy of CFD results depends on the quality of the models, mesh, and boundary conditions used.
- **Complexity**: Setting up and interpreting CFD simulations can be complex and requires specialized knowledge.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Conservation Laws

1. **Mass Conservation (Continuity Equation)**
   - Ensures mass is conserved in the fluid flow.
   - Formula: \( \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0 \)

2. **Momentum Conservation (Navier-Stokes Equations)**
   - Describes the balance of forces in the fluid.
   - Formula: \( \frac{\partial (\rho \mathbf{u})}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u} \mathbf{u}) = -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{\tau} + \rho \mathbf{f} \)

3. **Energy Conservation**
   - Accounts for the changes in the energy of the fluid.
   - Formula: \( \frac{\partial (\rho E)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho E \mathbf{u}) = \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T) + \Phi \)

### Types of Flow

- **Laminar Flow**: Smooth and orderly fluid motion, characterized by low Reynolds numbers.
- **Turbulent Flow**: Chaotic and irregular fluid motion, characterized by high Reynolds numbers.
- **Incompressible Flow**: Fluid density remains constant.
- **Compressible Flow**: Fluid density varies with pressure and temperature changes.
